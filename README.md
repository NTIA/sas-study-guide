ITS-designed configuration files for some of the tests included in the "WInnForum Test and Certification for Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) Conformance and Performance Test Technical Specification; SAS as Unit Under Test (UUT), Document WINN-TS-0061," are included here, as Tranche 1, as a Study Guide for Spectrum Access System Operators.
